# Apple 1 Computer Emulator

An Apple 1 Emulator made by myself in Java. The Apple 1 was the first computer made by Apple (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I) It uses JSwing for everything GUI related. All work is mine except the Apple logo favicon and the default ROMs. 

It features:
- MOS 6502 CPU clocked at 1MHz.
- Motorola 6821 PIA (Peripheral Interface Adaptor).
- 64 kilobytes of RAM.
- Fully working simulated ACI (apple cassette interface) with preloaded programs.
- Separately emulated raster-style screen (green text on a black background).
- 256 Bytes of onboard ROM, with the WozMon (Wozniak Monitor) operating system and vectors taking up 254 Bytes of it.
- Signetics 2513 64x8x5 Character ROM emulated chip, with character glyphs.
